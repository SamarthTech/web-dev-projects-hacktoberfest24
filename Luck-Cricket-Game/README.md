Gameplay

    Toss: The game starts with a virtual coin toss to determine who bats first.
    Batting: The batting player guesses "odd" or "even". A random number is generated and added to the player's hidden fingers. If the guess matches the sum's parity (odd or even), the player scores runs.
    Bowling: The bowling player tries to predict the batting player's guess and throws a virtual ball. If the guess is incorrect, the batting player is out, and roles are swapped.
    Winning: The player with the highest score after both players have batted wins the game.
